## Machine Learning 

The first question I get in my mind after hearing the word "Machine Learning" is, what does it mean? The simplest answer is following: 

***Machine Learning is mainly about extracing information or knowledge from data. This knowledge can then be 
used to perform various tasks, one common use case is decision making, or I can say automating the decision making.***


It is a research field which lies at the intersection of three research areas: 

1. statistics 
2. computer science 
3. artificial intelligence
