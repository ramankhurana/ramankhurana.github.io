## Machine Learning 

The first question I get in my mind after hearing the word "Machine Learning" is, what does it mean? The simplest answer is following: 

***Machine Learning is mainly about extracing information or knowledge from data. This knowledge can then be 
used to perform various tasks, one common use case is decision making, or I can say automating the decision making.***


It is a research field which lies at the intersection of three research areas: 

1. statistics 
2. computer science 
3. artificial intelligence 

The presence of its application is visible in daily life from past few years, automating face detection and tagging on facebook, 
automatic product recomendation on google, movie recomendation on netflix and translate the language by google translator are a  
few to name them. They all have made the life of human much easier and most of them have multiple machine learning models running 
behind the scene to serve the outcome we see as an end user.
