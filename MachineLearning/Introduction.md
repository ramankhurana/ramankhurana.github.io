## Machine Learning 

The first question I get in my mind after hearing the word "Machine Learning" is, what does it mean? The simplest answer is following: 

Machine Learning is mainly about extracing information or knowledge from data. This knowledge can then be 
used to perform various tasks, one common use case is decision making, or I can say automating the decision making. 

```ruby
print TTY::Box.frame { "Hello world!" }
# =>
# ┌────────────┐
# │Hello world!│
# └────────────┘
```
