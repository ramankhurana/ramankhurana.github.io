## Machine Learning 

The first question I get in my mind after hearing the word "Machine Learning" is, what does it mean? The simplest answer is following: 

***Machine Learning (ML) is mainly about extracing information or knowledge from data. This knowledge can then be 
used to perform various tasks, one common use case is decision making, or I can say automating the decision making.***


It is a research field which lies at the intersection of three research areas: 

1. statistics 
2. computer science 
3. artificial intelligence 

The presence of its application is visible in daily life from past few years, automating face detection and tagging on facebook, 
automatic product recomendation on google, movie recomendation on netflix and translate the language by google translator are a  
few to name them. They all have made the life of human much easier and most of them have multiple machine learning models running 
behind the scene to serve the outcome we see as an end user. There are numerous ML applications outside commercial regime. One important 
area is to apply it to scientific research where huge amount of data is present and conclusions are data driven. Searching for a new 
planet/star in the Sky, doagnosis of early symptops of deadly diseases, searching for new particle, analysing DNA sequences etc are a 
few to point out. I have been part of the team who discovered a new particle in high energy physics experiemnt, CERN, in year 2012. 
The particle is the Higgs boson. Machine learning algorithms have played a big role in discovery of the Higgs boson. You can read 
more about discovery of Higgs boson from these journal publications and also reach me to discuss more about it.
